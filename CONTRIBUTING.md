We love that you're interested in contributing to iOS Goodies! ü¶Ñü¶Ñü¶Ñ

To make the process as painless as possible, we have just a couple of guidelines that should make life easier and less frustrating for everyone. ‚ô•Ô∏è

Before we start, please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/iOS-Goodies/iOS-Goodies/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)(we take it very seriously üòÅ).

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute with a link to the current week's issue send us a [Pull Request](https://github.com/iOS-Goodies/iOS-Goodies/pulls). After being accepted, the article will stay in the repo, still **it does not guarantee that will be presented on the website, or the newsletter**. There are two main reasons for a contribution to be rejected:

* Each section has a limit of 5 articles (in special occasions, we can bend this rule and change the upper limit).
* **The article didn't pass our curation**. This can be for multiple reasons: poorly written, not relevant to the community in general, not up to our standards, etc. Of course this is very subjective and if you think we (Rui and Tiago) are being unfair, do let us know. 

## Requirements

Shouldn't be more than 2 weeks old (although exceptions can be made: e.g. Tools/Libraries). If it's an old article, but a good one, please let us know why you think so.

## General Workflow

Each week we launch the goodies on Thursday and create a new markdown file that will have the issues for the next week. Rui and Tiago are responsible for launching the Goodies (Website + newsletter).

## Categories

 * **Articles** - Generally speaking these are technical articles. They should expose the reader to code, but it's not mandatory.
 * **Business** - These articles should help the typical developer to understand how business is conducted. This could be related to the App store ecosystem, or how-to run your business as an indie dev, App marketing, etc. It can also be related about your experience while working at some company, what you liked, and what you didn't like. 
 * **Tools/Libraries**- Links to tools or libraries related to iOS development. Could range from tools like Sketch (because in one way or another is used while developing iOS apps) to [fastlane](https://github.com/KrauseFx/fastlane), passing by Trending Github repos (Objective-c, Swift, Objective-c++, etc).
 * **UI/UX** - Should mainly focus on UI and UX but in an Mobile context, user flows, [maybe describing a new pattern](https://dribbble.com/shots/1254439--GIF-Mobile-Form-Interaction?list=users). It could be acceptable to use an article that, although uses Android as the example, is applicable in iOS. Some articles for Web, can also be interesting to an iOS dev. 
 * **Videos & Slides** - Self explanatory
 * **Indie Apps** - Since it's quite difficult (or expensive) for the typical Indie dev to market his/her app, we reserve this section for those awesome people.
 * **Credits** - Comma separated list of contributors to the current issue. If you make a pull request, add yourself here like this: ``[your GitHub username](your GitHub link)``
 
In case the article is really good, and doesn't fit in any of the above sections, we will open a new section just for it. If you are unsure where to put an article, check the [website](http://ios-goodies.com) for some examples, or [just open an issue](https://github.com/iOS-Goodies/iOS-Goodies/issues). 


## Link Format

We use markdown for each issue, and each link should respect this rules:

* Should follow this format: ``[Title of the Article](link), by [Author's Twitter username](link-for-twitter)``
  * If the author doesn't have a twitter account then use his name instead of the Twitter username, without a link
